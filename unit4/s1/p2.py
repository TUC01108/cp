# You're responsible for ensuring the quality of the NFT collection before it is displayed in the virtual gallery. 
# One of your tasks is to review and debug the code that extracts the names of NFTs from the collection. 
# A junior developer wrote the initial version of this function, but it contains some bugs that prevent it from working correctly.

# Task:

#     Review the provided code and identify the bug(s).

#     Explain what the bug is and how it affects the output.

#     Refactor the code to fix the bug(s) and provide the correct implementation.

def extract_nft_names(nft_collection):
    nft_names = []
    for nft in nft_collection:
        nft_names.append(nft["name"])
    return nft_names

# Example Usage:

nft_collection = [
    {"name": "Abstract Horizon", "creator": "ArtByAlex", "value": 5.4},
    {"name": "Pixel Dreams", "creator": "DreamyPixel", "value": 7.2}
]

nft_collection_2 = [
    {"name": "Golden Hour", "creator": "SunsetArtist", "value": 8.9}
]

nft_collection_3 = []

print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection))
print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection_2))
print(extract_nft_names(nft_collection_3))

# Example Output:

# ['Abstract Horizon', 'Pixel Dreams']
# ['Golden Hour']
# []
